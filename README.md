***** Part One *******

Hazard elimination: Through coorecting the code I was able to fix many of the hazards but not all as some of the hazards in the code snipet were unfortunatley impossible to remove,
					I was able however to fix multiple by renaiming several variables so as not to overwrite addresses that were needed, I also deleted a subtraction command that 
					was overwritten by the following command, I also rearranged the commands that could be rearanged with out defeating the functionality of the program. In the end I 
					was able to remove most, but not all of the hazards.
