Rewrite the following sequence of instructions to minimize the total
number of hazards. Include comments in your solution describing all
the original hazards you're getting rid of.

lw  $s2, 0($s1)
lw  $s1, 16($s6)
sub $s6, $s1, $s2
add $s6, $s2, $s2
or  $s3, $s6, $zero
sw  $s6, 12($s1)
addi $s4, $s4, 10
subi $s5, $s4, 4

Note that the above sequence includes references to arrays at
addresses stored in $s1 and $s6. Your complete solution should create
some data (integers are fine) at those locations.

If you aren't able to completely eliminate all hazards, you README
should provide an explanation. How close did you actually get?

Submission instructions:

* Submit a complete working .asm file with the revised code snippet,
  including all set-up and data creation tha tyou need to make it
  work.

* Your .asm file should include comments indicating where you moved
  code around to eliminate hazards.

* Your README file for this assignment should include a summary of
  hazards you eliminated, as noted above: were you able to eliminate
  all of them? If not, why not? How close are you able to get?

For this problem, you will write a subroutine in MIPS that computes an
exponent x^k, where x is a floating-point number (single-precision),
and k is an integer.

Start by prompting the user and reading in the values of x and
k. (Remember that floating-point operations are special and unique,
including the arguments stacked for syscalls.)  Invoke your exponent
subroutine, return the value to the caller, and print the result to
the console.

Both x and y should be able to be positive or negative. Your result
should be a float.

Submission instructions:

* Submit a complete working .asm file that does the exponent calculation.

* Your README file for this assignment should include at least 4 values of (x,k) that you have tested and the results you saw.

# PART THREE. 45 points.

###############################################################

For this problem, you will write a subroutine in MIPS that
approximates the square root of a floating-point number
(double-precision) and stores the result as an int.

Do not use the MIPS sqrt instruction.

Start by prompting the user and reading in a double-precision floating
point number. Next, invoke a subroutine that calculates an integer
that approximates the square root, rounded to the nearest integer.

For example, if the input is 4.0, return 2. If the input is 5.89,
return 2. If the input is 500.1234, return 22.

You should verify that your input, coming from the user, is a valid
nonnegative floating-point number.

After invoking your subroutine, print the result (an integer) to the
terminal.

Submission instructions:

* Submit a complete working .asm file that does the sqrt calculation as described.

* Your README file for this assignment should include at least 4 input
  values that you tested and the results that you saw.
